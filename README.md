# Evolution: LLMs to SWE Agents
## From code completion to autonomous workflows

**2021: GitHub Copilot** — AI-powered code completion

**2022: ChatGPT** — Conversational AI assistant

**2023: LLMs & Web UI Generators** — Prompt to Web App

**2024: Agent CLIs** — Claude Code: File edit, bash

**2025: MCP, SKILLS.md** - Unified tooling

# CI/CD with GitHub Actions

YAML workflows as configuration stored in `.github/workflows/` that trigger on events like push, pull requests, issues.

```yaml
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened]
permissions:
  issues: write # danger zone
jobs:
  agent:
    steps:
      - run: copilot "Summarize issue and respond in a comment."
```

# The "Lethal Trifecta" for AI Agents

AI agents become risky when they combine **three capabilities** at once:

- **Private data access**

- **Untrusted content**

- **External communication**

> https://simonw.substack.com/p/the-lethal-trifecta-for-ai-agents

---

# Combine Github Actions and SWE Agents **SAFELY**.

---

# Loved by Developers

```yaml
---
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened]
permissions:
  contents: read # read-only by default
safe-outputs:
  add-comment: # guardrails for write operations
---
Summarize issue and respond in a comment.
```

> Natural language → compiled to GitHub Actions YAML

---

# Trusted by Enterprises
## Safe by default

- **Containers**: Isolated GitHub Actions Jobs

- **Firewalls**: Network Control

- **Minimal Permissions**: Read-only by default

- **MCP Proxy**: Secure tool access

- **Threat Detection**: Agentic detection of threats

- **Safe Outputs**: Deterministic, guardrailed outputs

- **Plan / Check / Act**: Human in the loop

---

# Compiled Action Yaml

```yaml
jobs:
  activation:
    run: check authorization & sanitize inputs

  agent: needs[activation] # isolated container
    permissions: contents: read # read-only!
    run: copilot "Analyze package.json for breaking changes..."

  detection: needs[agent] # new container
    run: detect malicious outputs
    permissions: none

  add-comment: needs[detection] # isolated container
    run: gh issue comment add ...
    permissions: issues: write
```

> Markdown workflows compiled to GitHub Actions YAML for auditability

---

# Safe Outputs

```yaml
---
on: 
  pull_request:
    types: [opened]
permissions: 
  contents: read
safe-outputs:
  create-issue:
---
Check for breaking changes in package.json and create an issue.
```

**Security:** AI agents cannot directly write to GitHub. Safe-outputs validate AI responses and execute actions in isolated containers.

---

# Network Permissions

```yaml
---
on:
  pull_request:
network:
  allowed:
    - defaults  # Basic infrastructure
    - node      # NPM ecosystem
tools:
  web-fetch:
---
Fetch latest TypeScript docs report findings in a comment.
```

> Control external access for security

---

# Getting Started (Agentically)

```sh
# Install GitHub Agentic Workflows extension
gh extension install githubnext/gh-aw
gh aw init

# Install Copilot CLI (optional)
npm install -g @github/copilot
copilot

> load https://raw.githubusercontent.com/githubnext/gh-aw/main/.github/prompts/create-agentic-workflow.prompt.md
```

> Built with AI agents in mind from day 0

> Quick Start: https://githubnext.github.io/gh-aw/setup/quick-start/

---

# Safe Outputs → Copilot Handoff

```yaml
---
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened]
safe-outputs:
  create-issue:
    assignees: ["copilot"]
---
Analyze issue and break down into implementation tasks
```

> Triage agent → Creates tasks → @copilot implements → Review

---

# AI Engines
## Multiple AI providers supported

* **Claude Code** (default, recommended)
* **Codex** (experimental)
* **Copilot CLI** (experimental)
* **Custom Engine** (bring your own AI)

```yaml
engine: claude  # sensible defaults
```

> Claude Code offers the best reliability and performance

---

# MCP Servers Configuration

```yaml
mcp-servers:
  bundle-analyzer:
    command: "node"
    args: ["path/to/mcp-server.js"]
    allowed: "*"
```

**MCP:** Extend AI with [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/)

**Managed endpoint:** https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/ with OAuth authentication

---

# Containerized, Firewalled MCPs

```yaml
mcp-servers:
  web-scraper:
    container: mcp/fetch
    network:
      allowed: ["npmjs.com", "*.jsdelivr.com"]
    allowed: ["fetch"]
```

**Defense in depth:** Container + network + permissions

---

# Monitoring & Optimization

Track workflow performance and AI agent behavior.

```sh
# View recent runs
gh aw logs

# Filter by date range
gh aw logs --start-date -1w accessibility-review

# Compile workflows
gh aw compile
```

> Lock files (`.lock.yml`) ensure reproducibility and auditability

---

# Cache & Persistent Memory
## Speed up workflows and maintain context

```yaml
---
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened]
cache-memory: true  # AI remembers across runs
---
Review this PR with context from previous reviews:
- Check for repeated issues
- Track improvement trends
- Reference past discussions
```

**Benefits:** Faster builds + contextual AI analysis

---

# Playwright + Upload Assets
## Browser automation for web app testing

```yaml
---
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [ready_for_review]
tools:
  playwright:      # Headless browser automation
safe-outputs:
  create-issue:
  upload-assets:   # Attach screenshots to artifacts
---
Test the web application:
1. Navigate to the deployed preview URL
2. Take screenshots of key pages
3. Check for visual regressions
4. Validate responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
5. Create issue with findings and screenshots
```

**Use cases:** Visual regression, accessibility audits, E2E validation for SPAs

---

# Sanitized Context & Security
## Protect against prompt injection

```yaml
---
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened]
permissions:
  contents: read
  actions: read
safe-outputs:
  add-comment:
---
# RECOMMENDED: Use sanitized context
Analyze this issue content (safely sanitized):
"${{ needs.activation.outputs.text }}"

Metadata:
- Issue #${{ github.event.issue.number }}
- Repository: ${{ github.repository }}
- Author: ${{ github.actor }}
```

**Auto-sanitization:** @mentions neutralized, bot triggers blocked, malicious URIs filtered

---

# Creating Agentic Workflows with AI
## Use Copilot CLI to generate workflows

Install GitHub Copilot CLI:
```sh
npm install -g @github/copilot
```

Generate a workflow interactively:
```sh
copilot
```

Then load the workflow creation prompt:
```
load https://raw.githubusercontent.com/githubnext/gh-aw/main/.github/prompts/create-agentic-workflow.prompt.md

Create an agentic workflow that reviews PRs for:
- Breaking changes in package.json
- Missing TypeScript types
- Security vulnerabilities
```

**Meta-automation:** Use AI to create AI workflows!
